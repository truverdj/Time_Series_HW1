#### (1)

Okay I did it...

#### (2)

It's been years since Matlab. Just when I think I'm out, they pull right back in.

#### (3) 

Here are some pictures. The case of $\phi=-1$ did not fly in matlab with the conditional parametrization...

$$
x_r\mid x_0 \sim N(\phi^rx_0, v_r); \quad v_r = \frac{v(1-\phi^{2r})}{1-\phi^2}
$$

...for obvious reasons. Additionally, $\phi=2$ exhibited some odd behavior that I cannot explain.

The code is here:

```
X_0 = [0, 10];
PHI = [.5, 2, -1, -.5];
ts = ones(8,100);
v = 1;
s = 1;
i = 1;
rng(642);
for x_0 = X_0
    for phi = PHI
        for r = 1:100
            ts(i, r) = normrnd(phi^r*x_0, v * ( 1-phi^(2*r) ) / (1-phi^2));
        end
        i = i+1
    end
end
plot(1:100, ts(8,1:100))
title("x_0 = 10, phi = -0.5")
xlabel("t")
ylabel("x_t")
PHI_n = ones(100,100);
ts2 = ones(4,100)
X_0 = [0, 10];
PHI = [0.5, -0.5];
x = ones(1,100);
j = 1
for x_0 = X_0
    for phi = PHI
        for n = 1:100
            x(n) = phi^(n-1);
        end
        for i = 1:100
            PHI_n(i, i:100) = x(1:(100-(i-1)));
            PHI_n(i:100, i) = x(1:(100-(i-1)));
        end
        ts2(j, 1:100) = mvnrnd(x_0*ones(1,100), PHI_n)
        j = j + 1
    end
end
plot(1:100, ts2(4,1:100))
title("x_0 = 10, phi = -0.5 (joint)")
xlabel("t")
ylabel("x_t")
```

Plots with their respective labels follow. It seems that the joint produced more, how should we say, believable series.

##### (a)

Integrating out the variance term from a Normal-Inverse Gamma should give a Student's $t$ distribution. keeping with the instructions to no reinvent the wheel, we proceed.   
Assuming the parametrization of the Gamma that I know and love from the Hoff book (601),

$$
\begin{aligned}
v\mid D_{t-1} \sim InvGa(n_{t-1}/2, 2/n_{t-1}s_{t-1}).
\end{aligned}
$$

We then have:

$$
\phi \sim t_{n_{t-1}}\left(m_{t-1}, \frac{4C_{t-1}}{n_{t-1}^2s_{t-1}^2}\right)
$$

##### (b)

$$
\int (x_t\mid \phi, v, D_{t-1}) \cdot (\phi\mid v, D_{t-1})\ d\phi
$$
